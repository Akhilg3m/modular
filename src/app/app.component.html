============================================
APP COMPONENT TEMPLATE
============================================

BEGINNER EXPLANATION:
This is the ROOT template of the entire application.
It's very simple - just a router-outlet!

The router-outlet displays:
- MainLayoutComponent for routes like /, /vehicles
- EmptyLayoutComponent for routes like /about

The layout components then have their own router-outlets
for the actual page content.

HIERARCHY:
<app-root>
  <router-outlet> → Loads MainLayout or EmptyLayout
    <app-main-layout>
      <app-header>
      <app-sidebar>
      <router-outlet> → Loads actual page (Home, Vehicles, etc.)
      <app-footer>
    </app-main-layout>
  </router-outlet>
</app-root>
-->

<!--
  ROUTER OUTLET
  =============
  This is where Angular Router displays the matched component.
  It's like a placeholder that gets filled with content.

  When URL is:
  - '/' or '/vehicles' → MainLayoutComponent loads here
  - '/about' → EmptyLayoutComponent loads here
-->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
